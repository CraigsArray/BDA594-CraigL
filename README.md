### What is Big Data?
  Big Data is best interpreted as data that has great demand in terms of quantity, time and change. Data that is so vast that must be analyzed quickly urges a new field, Big Data Analytics, to provide guidance on the best practices of transforming data quickly to be interpreted.

  ## Datasets
  [National Death Index](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/National-Death-Index-ta9n-3c8q-Archive-Repository/bdj9-ganm/about_data)
  ### This dataset could be used for a variety of purposes but I find it interesting to learn more about causes of deaths, location and time. I'd like to compare deaths over seasons in different cities which have distinct seasons or not, such as San Diego and New York.

  ## Book
  [Deep Learning written by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) 
  I'd love to dig deeper into the technical aspects of machine learning. As the 4th industrial revolution, the AI Revolution, begins, I'd like to really master machine learning to optimize all other avenues of work and datasets. It would be a great way to filter through large amounts of data in realtime.
